# OpenClassroom project 13 : Argent Bank

## Introduction

This project represents a web application allowing customers to log in and manage their accounts and profile.

It was bootstrapped with [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/) with [react](https://react.dev/) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The page was integrated from a [static site mockup](https://github.com/Cycle9898/OC_Projet-13_ArgentBank_Back/tree/main/designs).

Data is retrieved via an API. More infos on this API [here](https://github.com/Cycle9898/OC_Projet-13_ArgentBank_Back).

Data from 2 users is currently available through the API :

### Tony Stark

- First Name: `Tony`
- Last Name: `Stark`
- Email: `tony@stark.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Steve Rogers

- First Name: `Steve`,
- Last Name: `Rogers`,
- Email: `steve@rogers.com`,

# Getting Started (Back-end)

**This step can be skipped because the back-end part is currently hosted on a cloud platform.**

Otherwise, it is possible to test the complete app locally.

To do so, delete the .env file provided in this repo (or edit/remove VITE_API_URL environment variable) and follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Cycle9898/OC_Projet-13_ArgentBank_Back) to set up the
back-end part. 

# Getting Started (Front-end)

- Clone this repo : `git clone https://github.com/Cycle9898/OC_Projet-13_ArgentBank_Front.git`

- Inside the cloned folder, install all dependencies with : `yarn`

- Then start the front-end part with : `yarn dev`

This command runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser.

# V2 API documentation

The documentation for v2 API, a swagger YAML file, is stored in [the swagger folder of the front-end repo](https://github.com/Cycle9898/OC_Projet-13_ArgentBank_Front/blob/main/swagger/).
